## Overview
This project is a solo endeavor aimed at exploring the classic dining philosophers problem through implementation. It is estimated to require approximately 70 hours to complete.

## Description
The dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that involves a group of philosophers sitting around a dining table. The table has a finite number of forks, with each philosopher needing two forks to eat. However, they can only pick up the forks that are adjacent to them. This scenario leads to potential deadlock situations if not handled correctly, making it an interesting challenge in concurrent programming.
